1. JSON Web Tokens or JWT is a safe means of communication two parties.
2. JWTs work with a message authentication code (MAC).\
3. We use JWTs because they are lightweight, self-contained.
4. Expire and new are made with time.
5. The encoded JWT gives a Uspecific result for a desired time and is to be kept private.
6. Used to get authentication while letting the clint connect to the application server.
